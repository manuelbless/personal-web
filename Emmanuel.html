          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p> I started learning how to code a few years ago ,basically because I developed an interest in developing my own applications and websites and most especially games, and over the years of coding its been fun and tedious at the same time but one thing I always have in mind is that wherever there is a will, there is a way and I'd definately get to my destination. </p>

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>Music has always been a part of me in a subtle way, I have always loved music but not until I got to high school when I discovered that I had the singing talent as well and started developing the interest in learning the characteristics of a good singer, the types and the skills involved in becoming a better singer.Driven by the passion I joined my school choir which was one of the best in the country at that time,and basically where I learnt a whole lot about music.</p>
